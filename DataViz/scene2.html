The Happiness Score metric was measured in 2017 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the happiest"
The following metrics are estimates of how much they contributed toward the calculation of the Happiness Score:
Economy (GDP per Capita): The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score.
Family: The extent to which Family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Health (Life Expectancy): The extent to which Life expectancy contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Freedom: The extent to which Freedom contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score
Trust (Government Corruption) : The extent to which Perception of Corruption contributes to Happiness Score
Generosity : The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score
